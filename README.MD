Introduction:
    
The project is to plot two graphs together: Dow Jones Industrial Average and new Covid-19 confirmed cases per day.

User Interface:
* Run the main script.
* Enter the numbers prompted on the screen.
* The graph will appear after that.
* Rerun the main script to get the new graph.

Warn.
* The date includes from 2020-01-22 to 2020-09-02, and any number doesn't fall into the range will cause an error.

Conclusion:
* It is obviously that sometimes increasing confirmed new cases can lower Dow Jones Industrial Average dramatically.
