Introduction:
    
The project is to plot two graphs together: Dow Jones Industrial Average and new Covid-19 confirmed cases per day.

User Interface:
    1. Run the main script.
    2. Enter the numbers prompted on the screen.
    3. The graph will appear after that.
    4. Rerun the main script to get the new graph.

Warn.
    1. The date includes from 2020-01-22 to 2020-09-02, and any number doesn't fall into the range will cause an error.

Conclusion:
    It is obviously that sometimes increasing confirmed new cases can lower Dow Jones Industrial Average dramatically.
